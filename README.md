## Description
The WordPress plugin that provides small functions to help your website working better, especially in "some countries". The functions this plugin currently provides:

#### Replace Google fonts by 360 mirror
Google fonts (such as Open Sans) are blocked in "some countries". Replace the font URL from Google fonts (fonts.googleapi.com) to 360 mirror (fonts.useso.com).

#### Replace Gravatar images by local default image
Gravatar images are blocked in "some countries". Replace the image URL from Gravatar (*.gravatar.com) to local default image.

#### Add page meta keywords and description
This function is for SEO (Search Engine Optimization). Meta keywords and description on page are more easily to be categorized by search engine. The function will add the tags of articles to page meta keywords, and add summary of articles to page meta description.

#### Prevent spam with validation code
The reader must input a 3-digits number of validation code before submit a comment. The number is random and will be verified by both front end and back end. This won't bring much inconvenient to user, but can be easily prevent most of the spam comments. It definitely has the hole for hackers to attack. However I believe for most of the websites, it is not worth for hackers to spent much time to break it.

#### Add article copyright
Add a simple claim at the end of the article to announce the copyright. Also, it provides a link for others to include when copying the article to other website.
